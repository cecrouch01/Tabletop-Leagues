# Tabletop Leagues Presents: Colosseum

## Description

A full-stack single page app for organizing league play with Magic the Gathering.  Magic has become one of the more popular tabletop games in the world and often involves league play.  Colosseum creates an environment for enthusiasts of the game to create leagues, join leagues, view league stats, and view user stats in a fully responsive way that can be displayed cleanly among all devices.  This app was created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Vite, vanilla CSS, GraphQL, Mongoose, JWT, and deployed with Heroku. 

## Usage

The user is brought to the homepage when opening the app that displays a navbar, a list of skilled users, top leagues and a footer.  The navbar which is present on every page provides links to the homepage, user dashboard, leagues present and past, page to create a league, sign up page, and login page.  The footer which is present on every page provides links to the apps Github repository, the official Magic the Gathering website, and the Magic the Gathering Facebook page.  The dashboard page displays a card that consists of the users username, chosen icon, and stats.  It also displays a column of the users record and a column of the users active leagues. The View Leagues page displays all leagues along with a searchbar to find a specific league.  The Create League page displays a form that allows a user to create a league name, password, and description.  The sign up page links to a form that allows users to create a username, password for their account, give a description of themselves, and choose an icon to represent their profile.
